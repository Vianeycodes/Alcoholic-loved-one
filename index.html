<h2> Sip by Sip, My childhood changed</h2>
<p>
  Before scraped knees, I was hiding bottles in the closet or dumbing it down the sink.
Instead of growing up, I was forced to be the grown-up.
<br>
<br>
This space is for the ones who carry stories like mine.
For those who grew up in the shadow of alcohol — where childhood felt more like survival than play.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Here, your story matters.</strong>
Here, you don’t have to carry it alone anymore.
You’re not alone.

 <h2> Too young to fix you, Too old to help you </h2>
 <p> I was a child then, you are older now. I am living on my own building my life but I wish I could still help you.</p>
